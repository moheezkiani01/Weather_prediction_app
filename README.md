# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and evaluating a **Temperature Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict temperature metrics such as TMAX (maximum temperature), TMIN (minimum temperature), and TAVG (average temperature) based on weather and time-series data.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Temperature_prediction_model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook that contains the entire workflow for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## 📌 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)
- Visualization of temperature trends
- Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Future temperature prediction based on the trained model

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Temperature_prediction_model.ipynb
```

4. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to run the model.

## 📊 Output

- Visual plots for data exploration
- Predicted vs Actual temperature comparison
- Model performance scores
- Final prediction results

## 📈 Example Use-Cases

- Climate trend analysis
- Agricultural planning
- Smart irrigation systems
- Energy demand forecasting

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used
